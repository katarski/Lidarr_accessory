# Audit: what is still open

Generated 29 Sep 2026 from the read-only audit (6 areas, each finding
adversarially verified). 91 findings were confirmed and 3 refuted
(CLI-04, CLI-06, CLI-07: do not redo them). **89 are fixed and pushed**;
the 2 below are open, in the order to fix them (data loss first).

**Line numbers are from commit 98d2656, the commit the audit read.** They
have shifted since, so find the code by the function or the quoted text.
Where a verifier corrected the proposed fix, **Fix** is the corrected one.

How each fix was done so far: a Python edit script (exact-match replace,
abort on a count mismatch), one unittest per rule in
`tests/test_deleters.py`, the suite in the image on PARK, push, then
`tools/deploy.sh` (see HANDOFF section 1). Grep the suite for the changed
symbol first: green tests that never call it prove nothing. Where a fix
changes a verdict, diff old against new over real data before shipping (as
orch2 F4 did over Lidarr's 31,496 past grabs) and read the changed rows.

## 1. llm LLM-5 (medium) -- Content-identify's LLM 'tie-break' is given the leader alone (the rival is filtered out) and answers by title, and the result drove...

`orchestrator.py:4045`

**Status:** Needs the album id passed through the name-based hand-off (content-identify returns a TITLE).

**Evidence:** clear_margin (4038) is computed against results[1], but the tie-break list is `top = [r[2] for r in results[:5] if r[1] >= min_cov]` (4045). When cov1 only just clears min_cov (60), a rival within the margin (m2 >= m1-1) is always below it, so the LLM gets exactly one option and confirm_album_match can only rubber-stamp it. Live, 17 Sep 18:44:22: "LLM confirm_album: 'folder: CD1/Rollin_ and Tumblin vs 1 candidates' -> 'The Sky Is Crying'", then "content-identify: ... via titles ambiguous, LLM pick (11/18)", then "Force-import (superset) ... flipping release", then "Switched album 46858 monitored release to 117720". At 18:40:37 (8/13 = 61.5%, same shape), the returned TITLE was re-resolved downstream to a different album: "Pre-flight match: Elmore James / The Sky Is Crying (stats=12/12...)" and "Switched album 45212 monitored release to 112781" (twice, 18:40:46 and 18:40:49) on an...

**Root cause:** The ambiguity is measured on one set and the LLM is asked on another (filtered) set, so 'ambiguous' becomes 'one candidate'. Both the LLM interface (a list of titles in, a title out) and _identify_album_by_content (returns winner title) also drop the album id, so duplicate titles collapse and get re-resolved by a different heuristic.

**Fix:** Build the tie-break set from the same rule that made clear_margin false: every result within the margin of the leader. Do not accept a pick below min_cov, though. If the LLM picks a rival under min_cov, return None (undecided) rather than accept an album that failed the coverage floor. The clause 'if that set has one member, return None' can never fire, because when clear_margin is false results[1] is always within the margin, so the set always has at least 2 members. Drop it. Offer numbered options carrying year and track count, map the index back to the album record, and have _identify_album_by_content return the album id so callers stop re-matching by title. The same title-to-record collapse exists in dedup_downloads' LLM fallback (see the missed finding). Use one title/record resolver for both.

## 2. llm missed (medium) -- The LLM's owned-album pick is resolved to the FIRST album with that title, skipping the same-title guard, so a missing edition can be...

`dedup_downloads.py:277`

**Status:** Same refactor as LLM-5.

**Evidence:** album_complete_in_library guards the deterministic same-title case (202-225: when several albums share a title and any is incomplete, answer 'not owned'). The LLM fallback (270-279) loses that guard. It sends the LLM a de-duplicated SET of complete titles, then maps the answer back with `for a in albums: if a.get('title') == picked: alb = a; break`, which is the first same-titled album in Lidarr's order, whether or not it is the one being downloaded. The word-overlap guard in pick_owned_album passes trivially for self-titled albums, because the shared word is the artist's name. Path: a download named 'Evanescence EP 1998' gives norm_title 'evanescenceep', which differs from 'evanescence', so there is no same_title hit. Word-subset skips it because the title is self-titled. The LLM gets owned={'Evanescence'} and answers 'Evanescence'. The overlap guard passes on 'evanescence'. The...

**Fix:** Use one title-to-album-record resolver for every match source, deterministic and LLM alike. Send the LLM's picked title through the same same-title, year and 'any incomplete means not owned' logic as the exact match, rather than a first-match loop. Offer the LLM numbered album records carrying year and track count, not a de-duplicated title set, so same-titled albums can be told apart. This is the same resolver the LLM-5 fix needs in _identify_album_by_content. It must not break: an LLM miss never deselects, and the overlap and release-type guards stay as they are.
